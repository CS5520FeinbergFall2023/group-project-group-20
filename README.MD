To correctly build the Android project with Unity Resource, follow the steps below:

!!! There are some part of the the setting.gradle and build.gradle you have to edit. If you want to try the game part, you can schedule a zoom meeting with me so I can go through the steps with you and fix the problems.

1. Download the unitLibrary.zip file from this link: https://northeastern-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/lee_chih-_northeastern_edu/Documents/unityLibrary.zip?csf=1&web=1&e=z9d8Ml
In order to download this folder, you need to login to your northeastern student account.

2. Unzip the file and relocate this folder directly into the Android project's root directory (Put it at same level where "app" folder is located at). Then, rebuild the project (Build -> Rebuild Project).

3. If you miss local.properties file in the root directory, please add it. It should only contain one line: sdk.dir=/Users/chih-taolee/Library/Android/sdk

4. The project should be successfully rebuilt. If you encounter any errors, let me know. After the rebuild, you can launch the app. (The first launch will take time. It could take 2-3 mins approximately)
