To correctly build the Android project with Unity Resource, follow the steps below:

1. Download the unitLibrary.zip file from this link: https://northeastern-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/personal/lee_chih-_northeastern_edu/Documents/unityLibrary.zip?csf=1&web=1&e=vM0Itm
In order to download this folder, you need to login to your northeastern student account.

2. Unzip the file and relocate this folder directly into the Android project's root directory (Put it at same level where "app" folder is located at). Then, rebuild the project (Build -> Rebuild Project).

3. The project should be successfully rebuilt. If you encounter any errors, let me know. After the rebuild, you can launch the app. (The first launch will take time. It could take 2-3 mins approximately)
